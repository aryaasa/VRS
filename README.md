# Vestibular Rehabilitation System using Immersive Virtual Reality
### Vestibular System:
 The vestibular system is like your body's internal balance system, located in your inner ear. It helps you keep your balance, stay upright, and know where your body is in space. It's responsible for sensing motion, gravity, and changes in head position.
### Vestibular Disorders:
 Vestibular disorders can cause problems with balance and coordination. Symptoms may include dizziness, vertigo (feeling like you or the room is spinning), nausea, and difficulty walking or standing. This system aims to improve the precision and efficacy of rehabilitation exercises while enhancing patient engagement through integrating virtual reality.
### Rehabilitation for Vestibular Disorders:
 • Vestibular rehabilitation is a specialized therapy aimed at improving balance 
and reducing symptoms of vestibular disorders.
 • It involves exercises and techniques to help reduce feelings of dizziness and 
improve overall quality of life for individuals with vestibular disorders.
### Use of Virtual Reality (VR) in Rehabilitation:
 • Virtual reality (VR) technology creates immersive, lifelike environments that 
can be used for rehabilitation.
 • In vestibular rehabilitation, VR can simulate real-life scenarios and 
movements to help patients practice balance exercises in a safe and 
controlled environment
